#
# GitHub migration P4 (Private/research/session-2026-10-04/github-migration/
# PLAN.md, design items 2 and 4; lead ruling on PR #1234, finding 2). It runs in
# the TWO generated jobs at the end of each root workflow, `nikatru-collect` and
# `nikatru-report` (below), which need the gate and every lane the gate needs,
# check out ONLY the public shell repository, and run nothing from the private
# checkout. tooling/ci/gen-public-shell.mjs ships a byte copy of this file as
# shell/.github/nikatru/report.py, beside the generated <workflow>.json config of
# each root workflow (assert-public-shell.mjs limb A holds both to the generator).
# The report secret exists in the report job's last two steps (the send and its
# no-detail fallback) and nowhere else in the shell (limb H): a step that runs
# pull-request code never holds it, and the job that holds it restores nothing
# another job saved (limb I). NIKATRU_DETAIL_KEY is in each quiet job's hand-off
# STAGING step and the report job's send step only (limb J): ⏱ 2026-10-08 · A7-05, every
# quiet job runs the shell's OWN staged copy of this file (and of quiet-step.mjs), never the
# private checkout's; its staging step derives this run attempt's key (`derive`) before any
# private code runs, and the hand-off seals under that key alone (limb Z).
#
# Why Python: the job must run without the private tree, so the reporter is a
# file of the shell repository, and it needs nothing but the standard library
# (HMAC, JSON, HTTP). CodeQL in this repository analyses JavaScript/TypeScript
# only, so this file is NOT CodeQL-analysed; its one data flow — a red step's
# detail, read from a file, sealed, handed on, posted to the bridge — is the
# by-design flow, and
# tooling/ci/test/shell-report.test.mjs grades it.
#
#   Every quiet job hands its red detail over SEALED (lead ruling p7-bridge-payload-r3,
#   item 3: the private repo's test output and PR text never sit in plain text in the
#   PUBLIC repo's Actions cache). Its generated steps run the shell's STAGED copy of this file:
#   report.py derive        (the staging step, before any private code) this run attempt's
#                           key, HMAC of `<run_id>-<attempt>` under NIKATRU_DETAIL_KEY, to
#                           NIKATRU_DETAIL_KEY_FILE (A7-05)
#   report.py handoff       $RUNNER_TEMP/report-detail.md within the cap (fit_bytes: each
#                           red section's failing tests kept, its tail cut first), sealed with
#                           that run key and bound to its own cache key
#                           (NIKATRU_HANDOFF), written as .nikatru-detail/detail.sealed,
#                           and `has=true` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT so actions/cache/save runs;
#                           no key, no hand-off: nothing is ever cached in the clear
#
#   Two generated jobs per root workflow, so the job that holds the report secret
#   never restores what a job that ran pull-request code saved (review of #1234,
#   finding B: an actions/cache archive is shaped by whoever saved it, not by the
#   restore's `path:`, and can overwrite this very file):
#
#   nikatru-collect — NO report secret, NO detail key. Restores the sealed hand-offs:
#   report.py plan <cfg>    list this run+attempt's detail hand-offs (actions/cache
#                           keys) and write key_0..key_<n-1> and `overflow` to
#                           $GITHUB_OUTPUT; the job restores each into .nikatru-detail/
#   report.py place <key>   move the restored .nikatru-detail/detail.sealed to
#                           .nikatru-collected/<key>.sealed
#   report.py collect <cfg> every restored hand-off, carried through UNCHANGED (still
#                           sealed), as ONE JSON bundle {v, handoffs: {key: sealed},
#                           unrestored: [key]} within SEALED_MAX_CHARS, written as the
#                           job output `detail`; one that does not fit is named only
#
#   report.py pr-meta       (the gate job's pre-read, before any private code) the private PR
#                           as it is now through POST /pr-meta, signed with BRIDGE_READ_SECRET and
#                           bound to this run, to NIKATRU_PR_META_FILE; a PR that changes a
#                           RUNNER_SOURCES file without the lead's RUNNER_LABEL (A7-05/A7-06) is a
#                           wait recorded as the gate's HOLD (green step, `::warning`), which send
#                           posts pending; the step output `meta` is `clear` only when it decided so
#   report.py tier          (the pin job's last step, ci.yml only; runbook §0e rule 2) this run's CI tier,
#                           `light` or `full`, to $GITHUB_OUTPUT `tier` with its reason printed: `full`
#                           unless the run is a pull_request, its ref is not refs/heads/train/*, the
#                           NIKATRU_TIER_LIGHT variable is `on`, POST /pr-meta answered (the same
#                           read_pr_meta as pr-meta) and the PR carries no `ci-full` label. Fails CLOSED:
#                           any doubt is `full`, and it always exits 0 (the job output defaults to full)
#
#   nikatru-report — the report secret; restores nothing, runs nothing another job
#   wrote (assert-public-shell.mjs limb I). A fresh sparse checkout of this shell, then
#   /usr/bin/python3 -I .github/nikatru/report.py send <cfg>
#                           one commit status per lane the gate needs (state from
#                           NIKATRU_RESULTS, so a green re-run clears a red one), then
#                           the gate's. The bundle arrives as NIKATRU_DETAIL, plain
#                           data in `env:`; it is unsealed, parsed and checked against
#                           its own key (known members of this run, this attempt or an
#                           earlier one: a re-run of the report job alone reuses the
#                           earlier attempt's bundle; size caps).
#                           A bundle that fails — another key, another run, a hand-off
#                           moved to another key, altered, malformed — is COVERAGE LOST:
#                           every status still goes out without detail, and the step
#                           exits 2, never an empty pass. Having attempted every
#                           status it writes `reported=true` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT (a file).
#   The report job's LAST step runs the same `send` WITHOUT the detail, if that output is
#   not `true`: the step above never started (a job output may be 1 MB, and Linux refuses
#   to start a process with one environment string over 128 KiB), or it died. So no
#   hand-off can withhold the statuses (review of #1245, finding 1).
#
# Why sealed AT HAND-OFF: an actions/cache entry of a public repository's default-branch
# scope can be restored by a later run of that repository (a fork's pull_request run
# included, where Actions lets one run), an artifact is downloadable by anyone signed in
# (limb C), and a job output reaches a step only through an expression, whose value the
# runner prints in the step's public log header. So each hand-off is encrypted and
# authenticated (HMAC-SHA256 in counter mode as the keystream, encrypt-then-MAC, its own
# cache key — run, attempt, job — bound in) BEFORE actions/cache/save, under
# NIKATRU_DETAIL_KEY, held by the hand-off steps and the report job's send step. The
# hand-off steps run pull-request code of the PRIVATE repository, whose authors already
# read its pull requests; the key keeps the detail from everyone else. The worst a
# poisoned hand-off can do to the report job is drop the detail and red that step.
#
# The bridge's contract (services/gh-bridge/src/report.ts parseReport):
#   POST <bridgeUrl>   x-bridge-signature: sha256=<HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body>
#   {run_id, run_attempt, sha, context, state, summary, detail?}
# `sha` is the private HEAD the bridge dispatched (NIKATRU_HEAD_SHA = the payload's
# sha), never the merge commit a pull-request job checks out.
#
# ⏱ 2026-10-05 (gh-bridge f1, round 3; lead ruling): THE GATE COMES ONLY FROM A RUN THAT HAS
# ONE. The gate's context is sent only when the run was dispatched for a pull request
# (NIKATRU_P_EVENT pull_request with a PR number) or for a push to main or of a tag; any
# other run reports its lanes and NOT the gate, and exits 1. The bridge dispatches nothing
# else, so this is defence in depth: a run without the PR range can never write the
# verdict the landers gate on. The bridge itself holds the context to this workflow's own
# set (services/gh-bridge/src/generated/shell.ts, written by gen-public-shell.mjs).
#
# ⏱ 2026-10-05 (p7-shell-fixes, B1): EVERY POST NAMES ITS OWN AGENT. The bridge's route is
# workers.dev, behind Cloudflare's Browser Integrity Check, which refuses Python's default
# `User-Agent: Python-urllib/3.x` with 403 / error code 1010 before the Worker runs. Measured
# from Box A in the P7 rehearsal: that agent 403/1010, a curl agent 401 "bad signature" (it
# reached the Worker), and every report of R1 and R2 was the 403 — no status from the shell.
# post() sends USER_AGENT; the test bridge refuses the default agent exactly as the edge does.
#
# ⏱ 2026-10-06 (ops-followups-1006): A TRANSIENT ANSWER IS RETRIED. Shell run 37430771854
# attempt 2 went red on ONE `ci/lane-workers success -> HTTP 502 (GitHub call failed)` while
# 22 other posts of the same job returned 200. post() retries a 502/503/504 and a post that got
# no answer at all, RETRY_DELAYS seconds apart (2, then 6), then reports the last answer as
# before. Repeating a report is safe: the bridge's POST /report sets a commit status (the
# newest of a context wins) and edits, never duplicates, its marked comment, and the bridge
# itself re-reads by that marker before it re-creates one. Nothing else is retried: a 4xx is
# the bridge's verdict on the report, and a retry cannot change it.
#
# ⏱ 2026-10-06 (followups-r3, PR #16 review finding 2): ONE LAYER'S TIME, NOT TWO STACKED. Each post
# waits the config's `postTimeoutS` (gen-public-shell.mjs REPORT_POST_TIMEOUT_S: the bridge's
# REPORT_BUDGET_MS plus a margin, one source), so a post never gives up on — and re-posts beside —
# a /report that is still running. And a bridge 502 is retried only when its `upstream` (GitHub's
# own answer behind it) is transient too, or absent (the edge's 502): a GitHub 4xx behind a 502 is
# not cured by asking again.
#
# ⏱ 2026-10-08 (capture-detail-private): A MANUAL RUN'S RED DETAIL REACHES THE PRIVATE SIDE. A root whose shell
# `on:` carries `workflow_dispatch` runs its collect and report jobs on such a run too (gen-public-shell.mjs
# reportEventIf), and `send` then posts NO status — the run was dispatched by a person or the platform, not
# for a private commit, and POST /report refuses it — but ONE signed body {run_id, run_attempt, detail} to the
# config's `dispatchDetailUrl` (services/gh-bridge/src/dispatch-detail.ts). The bridge re-reads the run as
# /report does and files the detail on its durable PRIVATE issue. The detail is the hand-offs' text, which
# the quiet step wrapper masked when it captured it; this log prints only the HTTP status. Red jobs with no detail
# handed over still post their names; nothing red and nothing lost posts nothing. A 409 is the bridge saying
# this attempt's detail is already filed (the fallback step after a send that died past its post): not a failure.
# ⏱ 2026-10-24 (O-SCHEDULED-RUN-RED-DETAIL-NEVER-DELIVERED): A SCHEDULED RUN'S TOO. Such a root that also runs on a
# clock (e2e, codeql, extensions, build-platforms) sealed its scheduled run's red detail into hand-offs that no job
# collected — its report job ran only on a dispatch — so the public log's `RED <step> exit N` was all anyone saw. The
# generator now runs the pair on `schedule` too (reportEventIf `scheduled`), and `send` files that run's detail at the
# same door, the same way (UNDISPATCHED_EVENTS): masked by the wrapper, fenced as data, never printed here.
#
# ⏱ 2026-10-08 (gitleaks-pr-scoped-r2, review 26acc3ec finding 2): A GREEN GATE CAN CARRY NOTES. A
# quiet step's `::nikatru-detail::` line lands in its job's detail as a `### NOTE <step>` section on a
# green step too (the quiet-step wrapper), so a job with a note hands a detail over while green.
# Every job's NOTE sections are added to the GATE's detail, and a `success` gate posts those sections
# (and nothing else) as its detail; a lane's success still posts none. The first such note is an
# applied PR-scoped secret-scan exemption (tooling/ci/scan-secrets.mjs), a hole a reviewer must see.
#
# ⏱ 2026-10-23 (ci-gate-holds, O-FIRST-PASS-AUDIT-LANE-FIXES decision 2): A HOLD IS PENDING, NOT A FAILURE. The
# first-pass audit of 2026-10-17 counted a gate that only WAITS (a runner-source PR with no RUNNER_LABEL yet, which
# the lane is told to ask for before its first run) as a red CI run, and the lane re-diagnosed a red that was a wait.
# pr-meta records such a wait as a `### HOLD <what>` section of the gate's detail (HOLD_HEADER), and `send` posts the
# gate `pending` instead of `failure` only when the hold is the ONLY red (held): every lane of the config reported
# success, the bundle was read, the gate's detail carries a HOLD section and no `### RED` section. Pending is never
# green: a lander gates on success.
#
# ⏱ 2026-10-24 (ci-gate-hold-not-red, lead decision; supersedes "the step still fails" above): A LABEL WAIT IS NOT A
# RED RUN. The pr-meta step failing on a hold kept the PUBLIC gate job, and so the whole run, at `failure` with every
# lane green (#1037, #1049 run 40069468612, #1055 run 40079869892), and the owner read a red X for a wait. pr-meta
# now ends a label-only hold at exit 0 with its `::warning` HOLD annotation, so the Public job and run are green. What
# that exit used to buy, "a hold whose record is lost reads as the failure it always was", is now bought by a
# POSITIVE signal instead: pr-meta writes the step output `meta` (GATE_CLEAR when it decided the PR is clear: no
# RUNNER_SOURCES file touched, or the label present; GATE_HOLD on a hold; nothing when it cannot decide, exit 2), the
# gate job carries it as `outputs.meta`, and the report job hands it to `send` as NIKATRU_GATE_META. For a config
# whose gate reads the PR (`gateMeta`), a pull request's gate is posted `success` only when that signal is
# GATE_CLEAR AND its detail carries no HOLD section (the second witness, cleared). A gate job that succeeded without
# it — the output lost, the step skipped, pr-meta crashed before writing it, the hold record lost — posts `pending`
# when it is held, else `failure`; never `success`. The other reds are unchanged: a RED section, a lane not green, a
# lost bundle, pr-meta's exit 2. After the label, the existing gate-only re-run (pr-recheck.yml re-runs the gate job,
# GitHub re-runs its dependents, the attempt reads only its own hand-offs) writes GATE_CLEAR, and the gate posts
# success. The residual, said: the private status, not the Public run's colour, is the gate's verdict; a Public run
# that is green on a hold reads pending privately, and the landers still refuse it.
#
# ⏱ 2026-10-27 (ci-tier-shell, runbook §0e rule 2 "one full CI per batch, not per PR"): A LIGHT RUN SAYS SO. When
# the pin job decided this run's tier `light` (`tier`, above: lane-build deferred to the train's full CI), the report
# job hands NIKATRU_TIER=light to `send`, and the summary of EVERY status it posts ends TIER_LIGHT_SUFFIX, inside
# SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS (the run text is trimmed, never the suffix). A full run adds no word: every status posted before
# the cut-over was full, so a reader reads "no word" as full. NO SUCH READER IS IN THIS TREE YET (review of #1148,
# finding 3): the landing rule that refuses a light-green PR landing alone (lane 2's train-land/full-tier-ensure) is
# out of tree, and tooling/ops/land-rules.mjs / land-gate.mjs grade the ci-gate conclusion only. So the switch
# (NIKATRU_TIER_LIGHT) stays off until that rule lands: docs/ci/README.md "The CI tier", Ships OFF.
#
# Exit 0 every report accepted (handoff: sealed, or nothing to hand over; collect: the
# bundle written) · 1 a report refused or not delivered (a verdict that did not land
# must not look green) · 2 COVERAGE LOST: no config, no bridge URL, no secret, no sha —
# nothing could be signed or sent; send: a detail bundle that does not unseal (the
# statuses went out without it); handoff: no key or no hand-off key, so nothing handed.

#
# ⏱ 2026-10-08 · A7-05/A7-06 (system review A7-security-supply). The gate's read of the private PR as it is
# now used to be signed by tooling/ci/gate-pr-body.mjs from the pull request's own merge checkout, so the PR's
# code held BRIDGE_READ_SECRET. Now the gate job's staging copy of THIS file signs it, in a generated step that
# runs before any private code of the job, and writes the answer to NIKATRU_PR_META_FILE (outside the
# workspace); the body step reads that file and holds no secret. The read is bound to this live run: it carries
# this job's Actions OIDC token (X-Bridge-OIDC, minted for OIDC_AUDIENCE), and the bridge verifies it and re-reads
# that run, which must be live and titled with exactly this PR and head (sysfix-a4-gh-bridge A4-01, which
# superseded this file's first form: a run id the sender named).
#
# The same step refuses a pull request that changes a file the shell runs as its OWN copy (RUNNER_SOURCES:
# every quiet step's wrapper and this reporter), or the generator and register that decide what is staged and
# what every step runs (PR #165 review finding 4), unless the private PR carries RUNNER_LABEL, which a lead sets:
# after the merge every shell job runs that file, and its wrapper decides every lane's exit code. Shell-owned:
# the PR cannot edit this check out of its own gate.
# PR #213 review finding 3: also the shell's byte copies (what a job runs after the sync) and the generator's
# relative-import closure (a bent import lets --check accept a modified copy).
